Provides an overall Match (or fit) Score useful in ranking/sorting candidates for selection \nand/or development (e.g. Talent Audit).  It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development  needs/limitations. \nThe extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions \nto enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have \ndemonstrated critical job behaviours. \n  \nThe PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and \ndevelopment situations. It is valuable for identifying an individual's overall fit as well as likely areas of \nstrength and weakness relative to their behaviour at work. \n \nIn a selection context, this information can be used: For making interviewers aware of the areas that may need further probing. As a basis for suggesting and creating relevant interview questions. For identifying the relative strengths and weaknesses of shortlisted candidates.",

By offering a wide range of perspectives, 360 feedback gives employees a more thorough understanding of not only their strengths, weaknesses, and development opportunities, but also their impact on others.  360-degree multi-rater assessments are based on SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (“UCF”), using our proven library of research-driven competencies to provide opportunities for managers, peers, and direct reports to supply useful developmental feedback that they may not otherwise share.  SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback.  360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.",
